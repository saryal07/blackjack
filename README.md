# Blackjack
Blackjack is a popular gambling card game in which players attempt to make a hand as close as possible to a sum of 21 without going over.

Each player is dealt an initial hand of 2 cards. The first player may then choose to "hit" (draw another card into their hand) or "stand" (keep their current hand), and play passes to the next player. A player may hit as many times as they want, but if they go over 21, they "bust" - or automatically lose.

The dealer plays their turn last. The dealer plays by a fixed set of rules. They must stand if their hand is 17 or over. Otherwise, they must continue to hit until they reach 17 or bust.

## Scoring
In determining hand totals, cards get the following values:

- All face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10
- Aces can count as either 1 or 11, but for the purposes of our blackjack program, aces are always worth 11.
- All other cards have the value shown on the card (ie 2 will be worth 2, 3 will be worth 3, and so on).

## Outcomes
Each player (excluding the dealer) has one of the three possible outcomes:

- Lose: any player who busts or has a hand value less than the dealer, loses.
- Win: any player who does not bust and has a hand value greater than the dealer, wins.
- Push: any player who does not bust and has a hand value matching the dealer, pushes (ties).
